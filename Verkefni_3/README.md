6. As you walk around an AR experience with your phone, errors accumulate and a device’s position and orientation may shift. What is this called?

  * Error aggregation

  * Drag

  * Drift ✅

  * Error drops

7. Which best describes feature points?

  * Visually distinct features in your real world environment ✅

  * The best points of your AR assets

  * Where real-world surfaces need lighting for better rendering of digital assets

  * Where you should render realistic shadows within the game engine

8. Which of the following is not a technical constraint facing current smartphone AR technology?

  * Size

  * Scope ✅

  * Heat

  * Power

9. The benefit of inside-out tracking is…

  * The AR device has a clearer understanding of interior spaces

  * It’s the only way to know where the user is in the environment

  * The user doesn’t need external sensors to track the AR device ✅

  * It limits the amount of heat the device generates

10. A computer mouse is an example of a User Interface Metaphor.

  * True ✅

  * False

### Module 3 final assessment

  * True ✅

  * False

2. ARCore has a hard time detecting feature points on...

  * Smooth white surfaces ✅

  * Surfaces with contrasting textures

  * 3D artists

  * Texture artists

  * All of the above ✅

4. All Android phones on the market are compatible to run ARCore.

  * True

  * False ✅

5. When considering UX/UI, one good rule of thumb to remember with AR is:

  * Avoid cluttering the screen with too many buttons or elements that might be confusing to users ✅

  * Always require designers to create feature points before starting development on your AR app

  * Avoid thinking about the user flow too much before developing your app as it is important to keep an open mind during the design process

  * The widespread availability of powerful mobile processors in new phones has enabled high fidelity graphics for AR, so always focus on beautiful design

6. It is a good idea to use as many photorealistic assets in your AR project as possible.

  * True

  * False ✅

7. What might break immersion in an AR app?

  * Assets that attempt photorealism and disappoint

  * Peering inside 3D digital objects

  * Insufficient surface mapping data making objects float in air

  * All of the above ✅

8. To create your own AR project it is imperative to learn 3D modelling tools like Maya, ZBrush, and 3ds max.

  * True

  * False ✅

9. When it comes to UX and UI:

  * 3D designers will be experts at this as well, so development always utilizes the same person for both roles

  * They are complementary fields of product design, and generally speaking UX is the more technical of the two ✅

  * It is advised to avoid designing photorealistic humans

  * The most popular interaction mechanic is pinch and zoom

10. Drag and drop, Voice, Tap, Pinch and Zoom, Slide, and Tilting are all examples of what?

  * Scene keys

  * Rendering inputs

  * Basic interaction options ✅

  * Typical AR character names

### Module 4 final assessment

1. Hit-testing…
